# QR-Scanner-Assignment
This will fullfill all the requirements for the assignment  

On Scanning the proper code we can add item to our cart. 
If we scan any in-proper QR code then it will show us a toast to scan a proper code.  

Also this is an assignment which is based on scanning QR codes, so I haven't used any Recycler view or as such in my project instead I am using TextView for displaying the Cart
